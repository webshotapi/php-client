# Dev mode
If you want to run api-server client with own mock server set for local env

```sh
export WEBSHOTAPI_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000/
```
Then client will connect with localhost:3000. With this host you can mock original server.


# Internal test api key for dev environment
```sh
export WEBSHOTAPI_KEY=d609cd1c96102bed02739b328ff35eb9
```
